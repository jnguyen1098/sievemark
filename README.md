# sievemark

Just practicing cross-language stuff. Don't treat this as objective benchmarking
data (as I am still learning most of the languages I implement the algorithm in).

Each program will output the amount of time taken by the algorithm, in seconds. This will be aggregated using my script into a report.

## The Benchmark

Return a list of all prime numbers less than 100,000.

## The Data

|language|time (in s)|
|-|-|
c|0.016062
python|0.144541%
