Just practicing cross-language stuff. Don't treat this as objective benchmarking
data (as I am still learning most of the languages I implement the algorithm in).

Each program will output the amount of time taken by the algorithm, in seconds. This will be aggregated using my script into a report.

Inspired by [davepl's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3h62rgewZM). Go watch his channel!

## The Benchmark

Return a list of all prime numbers less than 100,000.

## The Data
