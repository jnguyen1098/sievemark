# sievemark

Just practicing cross-language stuff. Don't treat this as objective benchmarking
data (as I am still learning most of the languages I implement the algorithm in).

Each program will output the amount of time taken by the algorithm, in seconds,
to 3 decimal places. This will be aggregated using my script into a report.
